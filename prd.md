## Detailed Product Description
Based on firsthand experience walking the Camino de Santiago, this mobile app will:

- Default language is English. Services will provide spanish, korean, germany, japanese, Chinese.
- Seamlessly integrate GPS‑based navigation to show pilgrims exactly where they are on the trail and alert them if they deviate.
- Curate only the most relevant nearby infrastructure—such as accommodations, restaurants, pharmacies, and points of interest—displaying up to two suggestions per category.
- Offer data‑driven route recommendations based on popularity and logistical convenience.
- Foster community engagement through built‑in forums for sharing tips, arranging meetups, and reporting conditions.
- Centralize support resources like customer service, emergency contacts, and FAQs.

By addressing information overload, lack of real‑time alerts, and poor UX in competitor apps, ours will become the go‑to companion for both first‑time and veteran pilgrims.
